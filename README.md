# This is a Odin Project project

my first one to be honest.. im nervous.

not really though, because the only thing i should be learning in the whole program is **Node.JS**

If i find myself learningany Javascript concepts ive never heard of I have failed thus far.

I chose to do the Node.JS track because i previously learned Ruby up to the point where I would learn Rails, but there are almost no jobs in my area for Ruby Devs, even though i actually like Ruby alot.

I hope to be posting updates as the come to this though so stay tuned!
