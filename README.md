# This is a Odin Project project

my first one to be honest.. im nervous.

not really though, because the only thing i should be learning in the whole program is **Node.JS**

If i find myself learningany Javascript concepts ive never heard of I have failed thus far.

I chose to do the Node.JS track because i previously learned Ruby up to the point where I would learn Rails, but there are almost no jobs in my area for Ruby Devs, even though i actually like Ruby alot.

I hope to be posting updates as the come to this though so stay tuned!

## And its finally done

I was surprised how mucht trouble the styling actually caused me. Ovarall not to bad though, i spent alot of time fighting with flexbox, and meticulously placing things pixel by pixel.

The google homepage is not a responsive site so I did have to change some things as it has a scrollbar on smaller screens and i didnt necessarily want that, but mine breaks for smallest screen size also so that needs to be addressed on my end.

I got good practice placing elements, using hover effects, and using forms.
